# Darwin Gödel Machine Logistics System

A self-healing, evolutionary AI platform for logistics optimization.

---

## 🚚 Overview

The Darwin Gödel Machine Logistics System is an advanced AI platform that automates and optimizes logistics operations such as fleet management, warehouse automation, and delivery routing. The system uses evolutionary algorithms, real-time monitoring, and operator feedback to continuously improve itself with minimal human intervention.

## ✨ Features

- **Self-Healing Agents:** Real-time anomaly detection and automatic fixes.
- **Evolutionary Improvement:** Agents autonomously modify their code and are archived if they outperform previous versions.
- **Operator Feedback Integration:** Agents learn from human interventions and incorporate them into future actions.
- **Logistics Benchmarks:** Empirical validation using real-world logistics datasets.
- **Modular Python Architecture:** Easily extensible and production-ready.
